## Christopher Toplisek

As a mechanical engineer with several years of experience in the field, I have developed a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills. However, I am now transitioning to a career in software development and currently pursuing further education at the Makers coding boot-camp.

What excites me about tech is the endless possibilities it provides for solving complex problems and improving people's lives. I am passionate about programming and the power it has to create innovative solutions that can make a difference. With my strong background in engineering and my newfound skills in software development, I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to any tech team. I am excited about this new chapter in my career and eager to continue learning and growing in this field.

## Skills

At Makers coding bootcamp, I will learn the skills and techniques necessary to become a professional software developer. The curriculum is designed to teach me the fundamentals of programming, including object-oriented programming, version control, and testing. I'll learn how to use popular programming languages like Ruby, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, and I'll work on a variety of projects to gain hands-on experience. Throughout the course, i'll also develop soft skills like communication and collaboration, which are essential for working in a team environment. By the end of the bootcamp, i'll have the knowledge and experience to launch a career in software development.
