Transitioning from a self-employed installation engineer to a proficient software developer has been an inspiring journey. Armed with an MSc in mechanical engineering and intensive Makers coding bootcamp training, I've mastered OOP, TDD, Agile, diverse programming languages, databases, APIs, and cloud platforms. This transition blends my mechanical precision with software finesse, enabling me to optimize processes and foster innovation.

My long career as a self-employed engineer has honed valuable soft skills, including effective client interaction and maintaining enduring business relationships. These interpersonal abilities, combined with my technical expertise, empower me to create user-centric software solutions. I'm deeply committed to pushing boundaries, collaborating, and using this unique skillset to drive progress in software development, all while ensuring the end user's satisfaction.
